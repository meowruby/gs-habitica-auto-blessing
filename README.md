## Habitica Maximum Mana Exceeded report script to be hosted on Google Apps Script

This is a WIP of a script that pulls a list of party members and generates a report with a list of all members whose current MP > Max MP and posts it in the party chat. It reminds the users to cast their skills before interacting with tasks, habits, or to-dos which would reset the member's current mana to their max mana. 
Adapted from greatghouls Auto Blessing script with heavy help from ChatGPT.
